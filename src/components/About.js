    👋 Hi there! I’m Tommy, a code-slinging wizard 🧙‍♂️ by day and a problem-solving ninja 🥷 by night. I’m a Computer Science + Commerce double major at UNSW, where I’ve honed my skills in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and even MIPS. I specialize in turning complicated problems into elegant solutions and believe that great code isn’t just functional—it’s an art (it can be just functional if you need it quick).
    <br></br>
    🎨When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with AI 🤖, brainstorming business strategies 💼, or rethinking the McDonald’s drive-thru line efficiency 🍟. Let’s create something epic together! I am a software engineer with a passion for creating user-friendly and efficient web applications. I have a strong background in front-end and back-end development and am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
